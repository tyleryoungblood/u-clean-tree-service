### What We Do

Centrally located near Winnsboro, U-Clean Tree Service provides the following services throughout the Midlands of South Carolina.

- Tree Trimming
- Tree Felling

### How You Save

The concept is pretty simple. We cut, you clean. When the property owner takes care of the cleanup, the required crew and equipment is drastically reduced. This can potentially save the homeowner thousands over a full-service tree company.

We have nothing against full-service tree companies. They simply charge more because they have to. In order to trim, fell, and properly cleanup, a full-service company requires multiple vehicles and multiple people. There's usually a bucket truck towing a trailer and skidsteer, a box truck towing a chipper, and often a grapple or dump truck to haul away what can't be chipped. So when their bids come back at over \$1,000 a tree, you can understand why. They have insurance, fuel, and maintenance on multiple commercial vehicles and pieces of heavy equipment, as well as several people on the payroll.

### Are We Right For You?

If you answer YES to any of the following, we are probably a good fit:

- You're able bodied and the type of person that wants to get involved when a contractor shows up.
- You have a fireplace, firepit, sawmill, or some other use for the wood.
- You're slightly less able, but have access to help such as teenage kids or grandkids, friends and neighbors, or fellow church members.
- You live in an area without proper parking for multiple large commercial vehicles, trailers, and equipment.

If, however, you can afford to sit on your front porch sipping sweet tea while watching a full-service company trim your trees, we might not be for you.
